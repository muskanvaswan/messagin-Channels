# Project 2


Display Name:
When a user visits the web application for the first time, they are prompted to type in a display name that will eventually be associated with every message the user sends. If a user closes the page and returns to your app later, the display name should still be remembered.

Channel Creation:
Any user can create a new channel, so long as its name doesnâ€™t conflict with the name of an existing channel.

Channel List:
Users can see a list of all current channels, and selecting one allows the user to view the channel.

Messages View:
Once a channel is selected, the user can see any messages that have already been sent in that channel, up to a maximum of 100 messages.

Sending Messages:
Once in a channel, users can send text messages to others the channel. When a user sends a message, their display name and the timestamp of the message should be associated with the message. All users in the channel can then see the new message (with display name and timestamp) appear on their channel page. Sending and receiving messages does NOT require reloading the page.

Remembering the Channel:
If a user is on a channel page, closes the web browser window, and goes back to your web application, the application remembers what channel the user was on previously and take the user back to that channel.

Personal Touch:
user can hide any messages displayed by clicking on the hide button of the message. messages sent by the user, appear in green while those sent by other users appear in white.
